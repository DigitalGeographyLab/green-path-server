# Contributing

Please bear in mind that the current objective of the project is to develop a proof-of-concept of a green path route planner rather than a production ready service. This objective is used as an (bad) excuse for the lack of tests and many unoptimized chunks of code in this repository.

You are most welcome to add feature requests or bug reports in the issue tracker.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change (firstname.lastname@helsinki.fi). 

Simple typo fixes etc. can be sent as PRs directly, but for features or more complex bug fixes please add a corresponding issue first for discussion
