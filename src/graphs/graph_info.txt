e.g. kumpula_u_g_n2_f_s.graphml
u/d = unidrected / directed
g = missing edge geometries added
n = noise exposures added (as edge attributes)
n2 = fixed noise exposures updated (as edge attributes)
f = unwalkable edges filtered out from the graph (service tunnels etc)
s = subset of the edge attributes
